# Development of an electric window shutter motor controller
- This is the second version of my project
- There will be two boards, one for the high voltage components and one for the control logic
- There is a standard shutter ctrl switch (legrand) in the wall with 3 wires, that will be also utilized and will be connected to the controller board
- Shutter motor is generic, no electronic control, only internal end-stop switches (NC)
